      <p>West of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods
        that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope
        fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the
        glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there are farms, ancient and rocky,
        with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England secrets
        in the lee of great ledges; but these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling
        and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs.</p>
      <p>The old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there. French-Canadians
        have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles have come and departed. It is not
        because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled, but because of something that
        is imagined. The place is not good for the imagination, and does not bring restful dreams
        at night. It must be this which keeps the foreigners away, for old Ammi Pierce has never
        told them of anything he recalls from the strange days. Ammi, whose head has been a little
        queer for years, is the only one who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days;
        and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled
        roads around Arkham.</p>
      <p>There was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran straight where the
        blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward
        the south. Traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness,
        and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new
        reservoir. Then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below
        blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun. And the secrets of the
        strange days will be one with the deepâ€™s secrets; one with the hidden lore of old ocean, and
        all the mystery of primal earth....</p>
